/**
 * @class UIWindowManager
 * @extends UIFrames
 * Manages all windows, and provides window management functions, such as opening and closing windows. But you don't usually need to directly call the window manager's functions, because these functions are packaged in UIElement. When handling events, "this" can be used to visit these functions.
